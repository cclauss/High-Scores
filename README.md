High Scores
===========

High Scores module for Python.
By Tj Ferry.

This module implements a HighScore class that supports two main public methods:
+ `is_high_score(username, score)` will return True if this is the first score or the highest score for this user.  Otherwise False will be returned.  The `score` parameter should be numeric (int, long, float, etc.) and NOT a string.
